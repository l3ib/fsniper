fsniper is a utility that waits for a file to be changed or created,
and then executes a command on that file.

About
-----

fsniper was inspired by the need to watch a directory for certain types of 
files and move them to their appropriate location.  I wanted a utility that
could intelligently figure out what type of file I was putting in that 
directory, and move it to where it needed to go.  For example:

- Image files in standard background sizes/ratios should be moved to 
  /home/daf/media/bg
- tar files containing openbox or gtk themes should be extracted to 
  /home/daf/.themes
- Image files not matching standard background sizes/ratios should be
  moved to /home/daf/media
- Torrent files should be scp'd to my server, where rtorrent will 
  automatically start downloading them

See the RealExample section below.

Writing simple handling scripts, fsniper can detect these files when
they are written and those scripts are called.

Technical Details
-----------------

fsniper uses inotify to watch for when a file is closed after being written
to.  This means utilities such as touch will cause the event to trigger.

fsniper can watch any number of directories for any number of pattern 
matches on the files.  (Technically, it can only watch up to the limit
of inotify, which is typically 8192 dirs.)

Example Configuration File
--------------------------

Let's jump into an example configuration file.

-----------------------------------------
watch {

    ~/tmp/s {
        image/* {
            handler = echo image file:
        }

        *.extension {
            handler = ./foo a %% b
            handler = mv %% %D/arc-%F.txt
        }

        /.*regex.*/ {
            handler = ./bar a %% b
        }

        */* {
            handler = echo file:
        }
    }

}
-----------------------------------------

To start defining directories to watch, you must have a watch block.  Each
block underneath a watch block is a directory that fsniper monitors for files
that are closed (and that had previously been opened for
writing). Subdirectories are not watched by default. If you want to
watch them, you must specify "recurse = true" as the first line in the
directory block.

In this configuration, we are watching only one dir, ~/tmp/s.  Underneath that
directory block, we are watching for 4 different patterns of files.  The first
pattern, image/*, looks for files that match a mime-type pattern.  Any image 
file will go into this block.  The handler is echo, a standard system command
that writes to stdout.  fsniper looks for "%%" in the handler line.  The name
of the file, including the full path, that was just closed is substituted in 
for the %%. A "%f" is replaced with the name of the file excluding the path, 
and a "%d" is replaced with the path to the file excluding the trailing /. 
If none of these are found in the handler line, it appends the filename on 
the end.

The second pattern, *.extension, matches a shell glob for any file with the 
.extension extension.  This pattern has two handlers.  ./foo is a custom 
script we write.  If that script returns a return code that is not 0 or 2,
it moves on to the next handler.  See the Handler Return Codes section.

The third pattern, /.*regex.*/, matches the file name against a regular 
expression pattern.  PCRE support must be compiled in for this pattern to 
work.

The fourth pattern, */*, matches any file (by mime-type wildcards).  You could
also use *, which would be a file glob.

Configuration
-------------

fsniper's configuration file is located at ~/.config/fsniper/config
This section details all the available configuration options.

Matching Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three types of patterns that fsniper can match against.

Mime-Types
^^^^^^^^^^
fsniper can match mime-types, like text/plain, image/png, etc.  You can use the
file utility to figure out the mime-type. Use file -ib to get the mime-type 
that fsniper sees.  

You can also have wildcards on each side of the mime-type, so image/* would 
match all images, etc.

Shell Globs
^^^^^^^^^^^
The most common pattern would be shell globs, like *.txt or *.html.  This matches
any shell-like file pattern.

Regular Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
fsniper can be compiled with PCRE support to allow more complicated regular
expression matching.  Regex patterns are enclosed in forward slashes.  Consult
the PCRE documentation for the flavor of regular expressions supported.  Remember, 
the entire filename (including path) is matched against the regex.

Handlers
~~~~~~~~

The handler scripts do not always have to be custom written.  You can use the
% replacements to do some script-like behavior.  For example, this handler line:

----------------
handler = tar cvz archive-%F.tar.gz %%
----------------

Creates a tar.gz file containing the file that matches the file pattern.

Often, custom scripts are easier if they need to perform some complicated 
tests or if they need to indicate that they will delay.

Handler Search Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since fsniper uses the shell to execute handlers, the shell's PATH environment
variable is respected to find the handlers.  fsniper automatically prepends
~/.config/fsniper/scripts to PATH, so it is common to place custom scripts
in that directory.

Handler Return Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- 0 : the handler handled this file.
- 2 : the handler will handle this event, but not right now.  Retry again later.
- other: this handler can not handle this file. The next handler (if
one exists) will be tried.

Delays
~~~~~~

It is possible that a handler can handle a file, but not at this moment.  A
common example would be that the handler is supposed to scp a file to a remote
server, but that server is currently not available.  The handler script returns
a 2 to indicate that it can handle it, just not right now.  fsniper detects 
this return code and sleeps for a period of time, then retries the handler.

There are two parameters that control delay handling.  These parameters are
placed in the configuration file on the top level, that is, the same level 
as the watch block.

- delay_time : the amount of time, in seconds, to wait before trying the handler
  again.  If not specified, it defaults to 300, which is 5 minutes.
- delay_repeats : the number of repeats it should try before giving up.  This can 
  be 0, meaning infinite retries.

fsniper Files
-------------

By default, fsniper tries to load its configuration from ~/.config/fsniper/config.
You can override this by specifying a configuration file on the command line.

fsniper keeps a log file in ~/.config/sniper/log.  You can use tail -f to monitor
fsniper's output.

Command Line Options
--------------------

--------------------
	--help
		Prints this help text.
	--version
		Prints version information.
	--daemon
		Run as a daemon.
	--verbose
		Turns on debug text.
	--sync
		Sync mode (for debugging).
	--log-to=[arg]
		Log messages with specified way.
        Can be: stdout, file, syslog. "file" by default.
--------------------

Special Note: Firefox
---------------------
When dowloading a file named "foo", Firefox creates a "foo" with size
0 and a "foo.part" in the download directory. "foo" is closed for
writing immediately after being created, so fsniper will attempt to
run the appropriate handlers on it. Use the following Firefox
handler before any other handlers to prevent later handlers
from running on this incomplete "foo" file.

-----------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
# Handler to prevent later handlers from being called on temporary Firefox files

args="$*"
length=`expr length "$*"`
size=`du "${args}" | awk '{print $1'}`

# if this is "foo" and "foo.part" exists, firefox is still downloading foo
# so we ignore it for now. it will be closed and the handler called again
# once the download finishes.
if [[ -e "${args}.part" && "$size" -eq "0" ]]
then
  exit 0
fi

exit 1
-----------------------------------

To prevent handlers from being called on "foo.part" (which is moved to
"foo" once the download is complete), add the following to the top of
the watch block for Firefox's download directory.
-----------------------------------
*.part {
			 handler = echo ignoring file: %%
}
-----------------------------------



Real Example
------------

Above, we talked about a list of actions to take on some files.  Let's take
a look at an example configuration file, and the associated handlers which 
perform those actions.

----------------------------------
watch {
    ~/tmp/drop {                                 (1)
        recurse = true                           (2)         
        image/* {                                (3)
            handler = bg.pl                      (4)
            handler = mv %% ~/media              (5)
        }
        /\.(bz2|gz)$/ {                          (6)
            handler = theme.pl                   (7)
        }
    }

    ~/torrants {
        application/x-bittorrent {
                handler = torrent.pl             (8)
        }
    }
}
-----------------------------------

So in our watch block, we're watching two directories, \~/tmp/drop and
\~/torrants, as denoted at location 1.  

Line 2 indicates that we want to watch subdirectories of ~/tmp/drop
for changes.

First, we want to look at any image that gets placed into this directory.
We match against the image/\* mime-type, which means anything which falls 
into the image mime-type category.  This is denoted at location 3.

Order of your rules is important.  They are executed in order from first to
last, so put the most scrutinizing handlers first.  The first thing we are
going to do, denoted by location 4, is test an image file to see if it is a 
background image, and move it to my backgrounds folder.  This is at location
4.

[caption="Listing: "]
.bg.pl
----------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl

# requires identify from imagemagick

# if no arg, exit
exit 1 if scalar(@ARGV) != 1;

# get resolution of the image
($resw, $resh) = split /x/, (split / /, `identify $ARGV[0]`)[2];

# grep against standard horizontal pixel dimensions
$times = grep /^$resw$/, (1024, 1280, 1440, 1600, 1680, 1920, 2560);

# if we had a grep match, move it and exit
if ($times > 0)
{
    `mv $ARGV[0] ~/media/bgs`;
    exit 0;
}

# could not deal with it, let fsniper know to pass it in
exit 1;
------------------------------

Basically, the script looks at the dimensions, and tries to figure out if it
is a standard background size.  If so, it moves it to the \~/media/bg directory.
Then, it exits with the exit code 0.  This tells fsniper that this script 
handled the file, and don't run any more handlers.

If it didn't end up handling the file, we return 1 from the handler.  This 
tells fsniper to move on to the next handler in the list, which is at location
5.  We've inlined a simple move command here which moves any image file to the
\~/media directory.

Location 6 handles either files ending in bz2 or gz, which are typically tar
archives.  Location 7 details a script which will analyze the archive file to
see if it contains an openbox or gtk theme (meant to be put in $HOME/.themes),
and automatically extracts that archive there.

[caption="Listing: "]
.theme.pl
----------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl

# requires tar (haha)
# looks for a tar archive that has a directory entry that ends in
# openbox-3/ or gtk-2.0/

# make sure we got a file arg
exit 1 if scalar(@ARGV) != 1;

# get a file listing from tar
@list = `tar -tf $ARGV[0]`;

# see if we have an openbox-3 theme or a gtk-2.0 theme
$oblist = grep /\/openbox-3\/$/, @list;
$gtklist = grep /\/gtk-2.0\/$/, @list;

# if we got a hit, extract it and exit
if ($oblist > 0 || $gtklist > 0)
{
    # figure out the extraction option (bz2 versus gz)
    $exopt = "j" if $ARGV[0] =~ /\.bz2$/;
    $exopt = "z" if $exopt ne "j";

    # extract, move the archive, and exit
    `tar xf$exopt $ARGV[0] -C ~/.themes/`;
    `mv $ARGV[0] ~/downloads/`;
    exit 0;
}

# made it here means its not a theme archive
exit 1;
----------------------

If the script reaches the end and exits with 1, the file is simply left in
that directory.  Fsniper will not touch it again unless it is closed for writing,
which can be done with the "touch" command at the simplest.

Listing 8 automatically transfers torrent files to my torrent server, where
I rely on rtorrent to pick up its existance and start running the file.  The 
script is essentially a simple scp operation followed by a rm on the torrent
file.

[caption="Listing: "]
.torrent.pl
----------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl

exit -1 if (!scalar(@ARGV)>0);

`scp '$ARGV[0]' pintsize:~/torrents/`;
`rm '$ARGV[0]'`;

exit 0;
----------------------------

Here, pintsize is the name of my server.
